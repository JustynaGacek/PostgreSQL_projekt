# PostgreSQL_projekt

The application for managing relational database PostgreSQL, with a GUI created in Java using the Swing library. The database is located on Pascal server provided by my faculty. The application is used to manage a children's football school. The main task of the project was to assign children to appropriate groups, archive the necessary data, create statistics of achievements and manage the dates correctly. The whole code was written in Polish because it was a requirement.
